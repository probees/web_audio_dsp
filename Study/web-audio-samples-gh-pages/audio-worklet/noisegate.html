  This code illustrates a web audio noise gate implementation. A noise gate
  mutes sounds which register beneath a dBFS threshold. In this demo, the
  noise gate connects to an audio buffer of looped speech mixed with noise.
  In between speech segments, the noise should be audible unless muted by the
  noise gate. The user can adjust the threhold to remove the noise from the
  buffer, as well as explore the effect of adjusting attack and release which
  control the immediacy of muting and unmuting.

    <h1>Noise Gate</h1>
    <p>
      Hit play to loop a speech sample with noise and try to adjust the
      threshold to mute the otherwise audible noise in between speech segments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound registering beneath the threshold level will be muted.
      Threshold is measured in dBFS (decibels relative to full scale), where
      0 is the maximum level, and -6 dBFS is 50% of the maximum level.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attack controls how long time it takes (in seconds) for the noise gate to
      mute the sound once it registers beneath the threshold. Release controls
      how long time it takes (in seconds) for the noise gate to unmute the sound
      once it registers above the threshold. In both cases, the volume linearly
      changes to its new value.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the noise volume set at 1, the noise gate should mute noise in
      between pauses at a threshold of -40db. If you hear glitching, try
      adjusting the attack and release settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your browser supports the AudioWorklet node, you can switch between
      the ScriptProcessor and AudioWorklet NoiseGate implementations.
