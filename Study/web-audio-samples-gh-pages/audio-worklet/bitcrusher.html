  This code illustrates a web audio bitcrusher implementation, a musical audio
  effect. There are two bitcrusher classes. One is defined in
  bitcrusher-script-processor.js which binds the script
  processor node's onaudioprocess method to a bitcrush function.
  The other bitcrusher is defined in bitcrusher-audio-worklet.js and uses
  the audio worklet node. The user can switch between the two as audio is
  played. Both implementations enable a user to alter the bitDepth of individual
  samples as well change the sample rate by a specified factor.

    <h1>Bitcrusher: a lo-fi audio effect</h1>
    <p>
      Hit play to start a song and listen to the distortive effect of
      modifying the bit depth and sample rate reduction parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bit depth slider controls the number of bits used to represent
      a given sample. The sample rate reduction slider affects the number
      of distinct samples in the signal. Increasing this value simulates
      sample rate reduction by making intervals of consecutive samples equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your browser supports the AudioWorklet node, you can switch between
      the ScriptProcessor and AudioWorklet Bitcrusher implementations,
      but if switching occurs as audio is played, there may be an audible
      glitch, resulting from the ScriptProcessor's delay.
